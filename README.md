# INCOME/EXPENDITURE
Well this is a simple c code my friend in the university asked me to do.
I wanted to make something he could definitely defend.
This is just basic input,output and variables topic on c.
No data structures or even a header file...just plain.


## Improvements
1. I hope to improve the program by including a debuuger header i am still writing.
2. Include complex algorithms and data structures.
3. Save the information entered in a excel or a csv file.
4. Create a gui for the program using GTK.

## Todo list

- [x] Save info entered to a file(excel,csv or something).
- [ ] Create a python or java version of it.
- [ ] Implement a good data structure/algorithm for this.
- [ ] Later i will try making mobile version of it using ads, kotlin or a suitable language.

# INCOME_EXPENDITURE
Well this is a simple c code my friend in the university asked me to do.
I wanted to make something he could definitely defend.
This is just basic input,output and variables topic on c.
No data structures or even a header file...just plain.


## Improvements
1. I hope to improve the program by including a debuuger header i am still writing.
2. Include complex algorithms and data structures.
3. Save the information entered in a excel or a csv file.
4. Create a gui for the program using GTK.
